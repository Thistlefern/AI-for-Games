Welcome to my AI for Game Assessment!

This is a forest simulator, and you cannot interact with the world.

Simply move your field of view to observe the animals that are in this world!

To move your view, use WASD.

To adjust animal settings, you will have to open the Unity file included and edit their setting there.
